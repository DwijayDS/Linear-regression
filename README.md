# Linear-regression

The ﬁle ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The ﬁrst column is the population of a city and the second column is the proﬁt of a food truck in that city. A negative value for proﬁt indicates a loss. 

Here batch gradient descent algorithm is used to train the sought hypothesis.
Learning rate is set to 0.01 after ensuring that the cost function is converging.
Do not keep learning rate to be as high as 0.1.
